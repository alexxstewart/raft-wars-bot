# Raft Wars Bot

An attempt to automate the game Raft Wars from a Windows OS using the win32 api. The shooting mechanic in game has a randomly generated velocity so the game cannot be automated via hardcoding. The goal of this bot was to consistently achieve a highscore, however that would not be possible without a vision-based system which is far from the difficulty I had intended when starting this. I may attempt to implement a AI based system in the future to achieve the goal.
